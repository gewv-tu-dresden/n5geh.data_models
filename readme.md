# Examples of data models 
- This repo introduces examples of data models relating to building energy technology and district heating that have been developed through collaboration between the [E³](https://n5geh.de/e3/), [TWE-Flex](https://n5geh.de/twe-flex/) and [Digihast](https://n5geh.de/digihast/) projects in [N5GEH](https://n5geh.de/)

- The data models are based on [NGSI-v2](https://fiware-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html) from FIWARE and for documentation purposes are converted into [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)

- The data models are created in Juptyter notebooks and saved as a JSON schema. The Python environment defined via Poetry ([`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml)) can be used to run the notebooks. Install the virtual environment with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): 
    ```
    poetry install
    ```
